Description: Valid Improved Sparsity A-Learning (VISA) provides a new method for selecting important variables involved in optimal treatment regime from a multiply robust perspective. The VISA estimator achieves its success by borrowing the strengths of both model averaging (ARM, Yuhong Yang, 2001) <doi:10.1198/016214501753168262> and variable selection (PAL, Chengchun Shi, Ailin Fan, Rui Song and Wenbin Lu, 2018) <doi:10.1214/17-AOS1570>. The package is an implementation of Zishu Zhan and Jingxiao Zhang. (2022+).
